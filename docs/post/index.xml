The team’s mission was to
“direct high-quality traffic to our food stores and online journeys to drive growth of our Co-op”
The team was funded as a ‘run’ team, and was composed of several software and platform engineers working diligently to keep Co-op’s many web services running.</description></item></channel></rss>
